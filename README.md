# Head Pose Estimation

Head pose estimation means detecting the position of a human head in the image. Particularly, it means detecting the head’s Euler angles – yaw, pitch and roll. They define the object’s rotation in a 3D environment. If you make the right prediction about these three, you’ll find out which direction the human head will be facing. 

The ALFW2000 Dataset contains 2000 pictures of faces

Mediapipe library was used to extract face landmarks(936 points)
